A place to submit feature requests & bug reports for [YASAN Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yasan.space.mnml.ai.launcher&hl=en&gl=US).

I also do create issues on this repository to manage my tasks & let others know what is being worked on behind the scenes.

Note: This is an issues-only repository and does not contain any source code.
